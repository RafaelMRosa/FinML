Empirically it is understood on trading desks that some currency pairs tend to trade around a long-term average (mean reversion). This can be attributed either to heavily linked economies or similar trade dynamics. While every desk has their own way of identifying entry points to profit from this phenomenon, I aim to use a systematic methodology to pick stable currency pairs and exploit the mean reverting behavior. I use statistical methods to decompose the dynamics of approximately two hundred currency pairs and identify the pairs with similar risk charateristics, via principle component analysis.

I plan to supplement the existing work with statistical techniques to 'learn' when to take signals or ignore them, based on relevant macroeconomic and financial data.
