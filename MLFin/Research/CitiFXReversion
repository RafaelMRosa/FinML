    - rolling PCA on standardized vs. USD returns
    - k-means clusters on PCA weights and rolling return correlations
    - look at clusters data
    
- conclusions so far:
    - kmeans clusters aren't continuous, this is problematic:
        - e.g. AUD and NZD can both be in cluster 0, then a slight move could cause AUD to move to 4,
            there is no distinction between 4 and 3 in terms of similarity to 0, it's just a different cluster
        - should use a continuous classifier like pairwise distances in the PC weights space
        - the paper averages trailing 12m clusters generated monthly
        - so we're gonna use distances < threshold as our clustering mechanism

- Within clusters, generate MR signals:
    - z-score thresholds on rolling 30d returns -> buy-sell signals
    - apply to MLdP framework
        
        We have signals now on usd pairs-- not the goal
        TODO:
        1. Form "in-cluster" combinatoric pairs
        2. Generate pair zscore timeseries 
        3. generate MLdP events DF
        4. Size trades based on inverse concurrency
            a. maybe instead of first bet = 1, second = 1/2...
            b. we could do 1 / (w-1), where w = max concurrency so far
            c. this would have the effect of scaling into bets rather than
                frontloading them
        5. Generate pnl from sized signals
        


LATEST:
- on todo we did 4 on inverse concurrency, could do what's described later
- do 5!!
